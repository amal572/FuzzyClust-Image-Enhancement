# Fuzzy_project
we use some Fuzzy algorithm to solve some problems 
- cluster fuzzy membership using the c means algorithm and Gustafson Kessel to cluster and iris dataset to cluster the type of flours 
- image enhancement is the preprocessing task in digital image processing. It helps to improve the appearance or perception of the image so that the image can be used for analytics and human visual systems.
