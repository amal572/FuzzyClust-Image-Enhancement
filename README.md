# FuzzyClust Image Enhancement Project

The Fuzzy Project focuses on utilizing fuzzy algorithms to address various problems. 

## Clustering with Fuzzy Algorithms

One aspect of the project involves clustering using fuzzy algorithms. Specifically, we apply the C-means algorithm and Gustafson-Kessel algorithm for fuzzy clustering. We utilize the Iris dataset to cluster different types of flowers based on their attributes. Clustering helps in grouping similar data points, providing insights into the underlying patterns within the data.

## Image Enhancement

Another task in the project is image enhancement, which is a preprocessing step in digital image processing. Image enhancement techniques aim to improve the appearance or perception of an image, making it suitable for analysis and human visual systems. By enhancing images, we can enhance details, improve contrast, reduce noise, and overall, make the images more visually appealing and informative.
